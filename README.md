# First Project

A simple, responsive static website built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Responsive layout with a mobile menu
- Light/dark mode toggle (remembered between visits)
- Contact form with client-side validation

## Running it

There's no build step. Either:

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or
- Serve the folder locally:

  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server 8000
  ```

  then visit http://localhost:8000

## Files

| File         | Purpose                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| `index.html` | Page structure and content  |
| `styles.css` | Styling and themes          |
| `script.js`  | Menu, dark mode, form logic |

## Note

The contact form doesn't send anything yet. To make it work for real, connect it to a
form service (e.g. Formspree) or your own backend.
